<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>The curse of knowledge is the phenomenon of thinking something is easy or obvious because you have had a lot of experience with it. (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Simple%2520is%2520absolute%252C%2520easy%2520is%2520relative.html">Simple is absolute, easy is relative</a>.)</p><p>Explanations by experts are often hard to understand for beginners because they've forgotten what it's like to be a beginner. It is hard for them to “unlearn” the information and put themselves in a student’s shoes to experience the novelty of learning about this concept.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><ul><li>The curse of knowledge was illustrated in 1990 by a Stanford University graduate student in psychology named Elizabeth Newton. She conducted an experiment in which a person was instructed to tap out a given famous song like, for example, Jingle Bells, with their fingers. A second person listened to the tapping and had to guess the name of the song. The tappers had to estimate how many songs the person listening would guess correctly. On average they estimated that 50% of the songs would be guessed correctly. However, the real figure was only 2.5%. The people who tapped the songs on the table heard the song in their heard and thus for them the task to guess the song seemed easy. Thus, the reason why the tapper’s estimates and the real figure are so different is that once we know something, like in the experiment the melody of the song, it’s usually incredibly hard to imagine what it’s like not knowing it.</li></ul><p><strong>References</strong></p><ul><li>How We Know—and Sometimes Misjudge—What Others Know: Imputing One’s Own Knowledge to Others by Raymond Nickerson</li><li>“It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than the master can. […] The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten. He sees the whole subject, by now, in a different light that he cannot conceive what is really troubling the pupil; he sees a dozen other difficulties which ought to be troubling him but aren’t.”  -  C. S. Lewis</li></ul></div>
