<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Simple stems from the word &quot;sim- plex&quot; which means one fold/braid. Hence it's an objective property and absolute. The opposite of simple is complex.</p><p>Easy stems from the words &quot;ease &lt; aise &lt; adjacencs&quot; which means &quot;near, at hand&quot;, i.e. near to our understanding/skill set/something familiar. Hence different things can be easy for different people depending on their personal background. The opposite of easy is hard.</p><p>Not understanding the difference between simple and easy is one of the biggest problems in education. People assume that others will have no problem understanding something because it seems easy to them. But it only appears easy to them because they've seen a lot of similar things and spent a lot of time thinking about related topics. This is known as the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Curse%2520of%2520knowledge.html">Curse of knowledge</a>.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><ul><li>Eating less than you burn is simple, but not easy for most people.</li><li>Making something people want is simple, but oftentimes not easy.</li><li>Telling a story about characters who grow is simple, but typically not easy.</li></ul><p><strong>References</strong></p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Simple made easy</a> - talk by Rich Hickey</li><li>The gneral idea is nicely illustrated by the following story Andrew Low told in his lectures on finance theory in the fall of 2008: <ul><li>&quot;&quot;You’re going to have to focus on two concepts that are probably alien to you. The notion of a stock and a flow. Now when I say stock, I don’t mean common stock or equities, I have a different term in mind. By stock in this context, I mean the stock of assets. The level of assets. And by flow I mean the rate of change of assets. You know when I was in grad school, we started discussing this concept on the first day of macroeconomics, and then one of the students in the back of the room said, excuse me, Professor, but isn’t that just the distinction between a variable and its first derivative? And the professor was a little bit taken aback and said, well, yes, that’s right. But let me give you another way of thinking about it that is somewhat more intuitive. And that is, think about a bathtub, and think about the faucet turned on and the water flowing into it. The stock is the level of the water. The flow is how fast the water is coming into the tub. And so after that explanation the student still seemed confused, and so the professor said, you know what, some people find bathtubs intuitive, other people find derivatives intuitive. So to each his own.&quot;</li></ul></li></ul></div>
