It was necessary for them to guess at the proper route to get them there, and to do so they needed a guide. This guide is primarily analogy.&quot; - Poincaré</li><li>&quot;Although many textbooks written by physicists paint physics as a purely deductive science, a good number of others effectively counter that image. And some of the greatest physicists have even tried to elucidate the pathways of thought that once led them to their most important discoveries. They invariably tell stories of analogies that came to them — analogies establishing links between just-discovered, fresh, unexplored physical phenomena and older, well-explored, and clearly understood physical phenomena.&quot; - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Surfaces%2520and%2520Essences%253A%2520Analogy%2520as%2520the%2520Fuel%2520and%2520Fire%2520of%2520Thinking.html">Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking</a> by Douglas Hofstadter and  Emmanuel Sander</li><li>&quot;But what are we really trying to do when we try to understand anything? Like children trying to describe nonsense objects, so in trying to understand a thing we are trying to find a metaphor for that thing. Not just any metaphor, but one with something more familiar and easy to our attention. Understanding a thing is to arrive at a metaphor for that thing by substituting something more familiar to us. And the feeling of familiarity is the feeling of understanding. The Bohr model of the atom is that of a proton surrounded by orbiting electrons. It is something like the pattern of the solar system, and that is indeed one of its metaphoric sources. Bohr’s theory was that all atoms were similar to his model. The theory, with the more recent discovery of new particles and complicated interatomic relationships, has turned out not to be true. But the model remains. A model is neither true nor false; only the theory of its similarity to what it represents. <em>A theory is thus a metaphor between a model and data. And understanding in science is the feeling of similarity between complicated data and a familiar model.</em>  [...] An analog is a model, but a model of a special kind. It is not like a scientific model, whose source may be anything at all and whose purpose is to act as an hypothesis of explanation or understanding. Instead, an analog is at every point generated by the thing it is an analog of. A map is a good example. It is not a model in the scientific sense, not a hypothetical model like the Bohr atom to explain something unknown. Instead, it is constructed from something well known, if not completely known. Each region of a district of land is allotted a corresponding region on the map, though the materials of land and map are absolutely different and a large proportion of the features of the land have to be left out. And the relation between an analog map and its land is a metaphor. If I point to a location on a map and say, &quot;There is Mont Blanc and from Chamonix we can reach the east face this way,&quot; that is really a shorthand way of saying, &quot;The relations between the point labeled 'Mont Blanc' and other points is similar to the actual Mont Blanc and its neighboring regions.&quot;  - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Origins%2520of%2520Consciousness%2520in%2520the%2520Breakdown%2520of%2520the%2520Bicamerial%2520Mind.html">The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicamerial Mind</a> by Julian Jaynes</li><li>Metaphors We Live By by George Lakoff shows that we understand abstract concepts entirely through metaphors relating them to physical events. </li><li>&quot;Good mathematicians see analogies between theorems or theories, but the very best ones see analogies between analogies.&quot; - Stefan Banach</li><li>James Clerk Maxwell once observed that rather than being attracted by parallels between different principles of physics, he was attracted by parallels between parallels, which would certainly seem to be the quintessence of abstraction.</li><li>&quot;Ideas don’t come out of thin air&quot;</li></ul></div>
