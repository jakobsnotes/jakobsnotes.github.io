<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Peer review simply isn't what non-academics think it is. Peer-reviewers don't check your formulas, they don't come to your lab to check your setup etc. Instead, it's simply an &quot;approved&quot; researcher offering an opinion on the relevance of your paper. That's it. Errors are traditionally reported as response papers not through peer review.</p><p>Reviewers primarily express an opinion if the submitted paper is relevant enough for the journal in question. Sometimes they point out typos. Often they ask you to add additional references.</p><p>It would take a reviewer months to check the validity of a paper and in most cases it's simply impossible because they don't have the code, the data, and the experimental setup. Results get checked when other researchers try to reproduce papers during their own projects.</p><p>Moreover, powerful and famous scientists can get anything published in the best journals because reviewers are afraid of what could happen if they reject their paper and he or she somehow found out. (Most scientific communities are small and most scientists are good at identifying &quot;anonymous&quot; reviewers.)</p><p>In fact, peer review does a lot of damage and not just by suppressing ideas that don't fit into the mainstream narrative. Bad paper with a stamp of approval does 1000 times the harm of a bad paper without such a stamp. People trust the stamps. Without any such &quot;gold standard stamp&quot; (or by learning that it doesn't say what they think it says) people would quickly learn to think for themselves. The situation in physics isn't that bad. Everyone uses the arXiv and even though people still publish in journals (necessary to find jobs and get grants), no one reads or otherwise cares about the journals. If a new paper comes out that proposes something &quot;spectacular&quot;, people look at it themselves or wait until a few people they trust write something about it.</p><p>What is necessary to minimize the influence of &quot;bad&quot; papers is that the public has to learn how to interpret the results of studies (sample size? randomized?) without any gatekeepers that &quot;free them from the burden of thinking for themselves&quot;. People typically say this will never happen but I think there's a real chance. The situation is somewhat analogous to when people first moved to city and then had to learn hygiene rules the hard way. Similarly, people currently have to learn digital hygiene (avoid clickbait etc.) and eventually they'll learn <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Scientific%2520hygiene.html">Scientific hygiene</a>.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><ul><li>&quot;The pressure for conformity is enormous. I have experienced it in editors’ rejection of submitted papers, based on venomous criticism of anonymous referees. The replacement of impartial reviewing by censorship will be the death of science.&quot; - Julian Schwinger</li></ul></div>
